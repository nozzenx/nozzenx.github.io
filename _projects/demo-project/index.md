title: 3D Door and Robot Arm Animation
description:  This project is my final project for the '3D Animation for Games' course in the 2nd year of the Digital Game Design Department at Ä°stinye University. A mine cart passes through a relatively complex gate, and a robotic arm picks up the carried basket and places it next to the other baskets. It was completed on January 15, 2025.

skills: 
  - 3D Modelling
  - 3D Animation

You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}
