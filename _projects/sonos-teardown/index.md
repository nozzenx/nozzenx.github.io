title: Kingdom Destiny Of Babylon 
description:  This project was developed as the final assignment for the "Game Design Studio 2" course in the 2nd year of the Digital Game Design Department at Istinye University. It is a reinterpretation and complete remake of an existing game, created with a new perspective.

The project was completed by a team of three members (two designers and one programmer) over a period of two weeks. Inspired by the Kingdom game series, it was developed as if it were a DLC for Kingdom: Two Crowns, strictly for educational purposes. There is absolutely no intention of making any profit from this project.

The game was built from scratch using the Unity game engine. Due to the short development time, it may contain some bugs, but it is fully playable.
